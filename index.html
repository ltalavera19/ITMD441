        <h2>My Web Experience </h2>
        <p>I have been going to IIT since 2020 and I have taken a lot of web development classes including
            the recommended prerequisite for this class in particular. I also taken some web development
            classes in high school during my senior year in preparation for what I knew I wanted to study at IIT.  
            My major is Information Technology and Management and I currently work for Apple as a field design engineer
            and I do have a good amount of web development experience.</p>
